          <h3>Welcome to EventBook the Ultimate Scheduler Brought to you by MistyPanda</h3>

<p>Even in our small community we are flooded with emails, posters and other ads for various events on campus. Our lives would be much easier and better served if 

there were some system that brings all of these events together. This goal can become a reality using the new Ultimate Scheduler, EventBook. This mobile app will be 

capable of consolidating all events on campus (club activities, sports, FAEâ€™s, etc.) in one common place. Not only will you be able to see an event, but also you 

will be able to upload pics taken on you device. This way you can be sure an event you are interested in is worth the hype.</p>
